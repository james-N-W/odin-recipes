# Web Development Project: Beginner Portfolio Website

## Introduction

Welcome! This project is a beginner-level web development exercise designed to introduce and reinforce essential front-end development skills. The goal is to build a simple personal portfolio website that showcases my work and skills using only basic HTML5.

By completing this project, I aim to understand how websites are structured. Itâ€™s also a chance to create something that I can use as part of my online presence as I continue learning.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Structuring content using **HTML5**      
- Organizing files and using a proper **folder structure** for a web project  
- Embedding images and links

## Completing the project

After completing this project, I have a much better understanding of how web pages are built from the ground up. I can now confidently create basic websites and troubleshoot layout issues. This project also gave me a strong foundation in version control with Git.
